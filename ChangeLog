2007-2-15 Max Derhak
  * Fixed bug with reading Profile Sequence Description tag.
  * Added accessor to CIccCLUT m_nPrecision member variable.
  * Added accessor to elements attached to a CIccTagMPE object.
  * Added utiltity function icGetSigStr() that displays a signature as a 4 characher
    string or as an 8 character hex number if the signature contains non alpha-numeric
    characters.
  * Minor formating changes to icProfileHeader.  Commented enums modified to eliminate
    compiler warnings.
      
2007-1-19 Max Derhak
  * Added ability to use multiple inheritance for CIccTag co-derived on IIccExtensionTag
    interface and accessed through a GetExtension() virtual function.
  * Various bug fixes when using Matrix/TRC profiles
  * Fixed various bugs with extracting tone curves from transforms attached to a CMM.
  * Added option to allow V2 to V4 encoding without clipping.

2006-12-29
  * Added CIccCmmMru extension CMM class which provides limited caching of last few unique
    color transforms.  This is a limited performance improvement for SampleIccCmm.
  * Added ability to detach IO operations to all profiles associated with a CMM.  This allows
    a tranform to be loaded an initialized and disconnect from the source before applying
    transforms.
  
2006-12-28
  * Created SampleIccCmm for Windows platforms.  This allows Windows applications to make use
    SampleICC's proflib through Windows ICM API.
  * Added ability to get access to the colorspaces of the first and last transform attached to a CMM.
  
2006-12-06 Kevin Wheatley
  * Miscelaneouos Bug Fixes
  * Clean up of various compiler warnings

2006-11-22 Max Derhak
  * Added newly approved technology tag signatures for Motion Picture Industry to
    icProfileHeader.h

2006-11-07 Max Derhak
  * Added support for optional multiProcessingElementType tags.  These tags provide
    an arbitrary order of curves, matricies, and N-D luts encoded using floating
    point.  The CIccTagMultiProcessElement class implements these objects.  MPE based tags
    can have 1 or more CIccMultiProcessElement based objects attached to them.
    See CIccMpeCurveSet, CIccMpeMatrix, CIccMpeCLUT for more details.  Additional future
    placeholder elements CIccMpeBAcs and CIccMpeEAcs objects are defined, but provide no
    processing capabilities. See additions to Icc Specification for more details
    releated to optional MPE based tags.  
  * Added CmdLine tool IccV4ToMPE that allows one to populate MPE based tags based upon
    contents of LutAtoB and LutBtoA based tags.
  
2006-10-30 Max Derhak
  * Added direct accessors CIccTagMultiLocalizedUnicode::Find() and 
    CIccTagMultiLocalizedUnicode::SetText() for easier creation of 
    multiLocalizedUnicode based tags
  
2006-10-27 Max Derhak
  * Added CIccTagCurve::SetGamma member function
  * Added validation check for single entry (gamma) curves to CIccTagLut8
    and CIccTagLut16

2006-10-10 Rohit Patil
  * Added IsIdentity() function to the CIccCurve and CIccMatrix classes which returns true
    if they are identity
  * Modified the Xform objects in the CMM to use the IsIdentity() function. 
    Now CIccXform::Apply() will not apply the curves or the matrix if 
    they are identity, to improve the CMM performance

2006-10-06 Max Derhak
  * Added CmdLine tool iccStripUnkownTags to remove tags not defined
    in the Icc Specification from a profile.

2006-07-31  Max Derhak
  * Fixed bug in CIccTagChromaticity::Validate() to make comparisons
    with fixed floating point encoding rather than IEEE encoding

2006-07-13  Max Derhak
  * Fixed bug with displaying icSigPerceptualRenderingIntentGamutTag
    tag's name correctly
  * Added icVectorApplyMatrix3x3() to IccUtil

2006-06-09  Max Derhak
  * Added concept of Device Lab and XYZ separate from PCS Lab
    and XYZ.  Encoding for these color spaces by devices is not
    defined by the ICC specification.

2006-05-09  Max Derhak

  * Cleanup to get things to work with VC6.
  
  * Reformated text replacing tabs with spaces.

2006-03-24  Joseph Goldstone  <joseph@Cloudbase.local>

  * Add a cut-and-paste of ab_lib_id3.m4 from Oskar Liljeblad
    (oskar@osk.mine.nu) as published in the autoconf archive,
    downloadable at http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to/ac_lib_id3.m4,
    to produce AC_LIB_TIFF.  Use the resulting TIFF_CPPFLAGS,
    TIFF_LDFLAGS and TIFF_LIBS in the Makefile.am file in the
    Tools/CmdLine/IccApplyProfile subdir.

  * Add a dist-hook target in the top-level Makefile.am that gets
    rid of any .DS_Store files.

  * Correct capitalization of SUBDIRS in Tools/CmdLine/Makefile.am
    so that we have a chance of running on Red Hat et al.

2006-02-18  Joseph Goldstone  <joseph@Cloudbase.local>

  * Initial attempt at using GNU suite (automake, autoconf,
    [g]libtool) to build IccProfLib and command-line tools.
